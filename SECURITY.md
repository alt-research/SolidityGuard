**Email**: maintainers@altresear.ch

**Please include**:
- Description of the vulnerability

- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

**Do NOT**:
- Open a public issue for security vulnerabilities
- Exploit the vulnerability beyond what is needed to demonstrate it

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix**: As soon as reasonably possible, depending on severity

## Scope

This security policy covers:
- The SolidityGuard web application (solidityguard.org)
